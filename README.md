Campaigns ideas
Okay as of now each member of the Panda group created many ideas regarding- campaigns for market profit. Each idea was great our group choose snowboarding. Snowboarding sights—secrete sights—gear—pricing—and prodigies whom snowboarded in our area as well as in our state, including the date and time and place of many snowboarding events.
I understand the homework required establishing an online colloquy idea, whereas your deliverable idea could attract many prospects i.e. buyers and campaigners searching for a credible idea. 
Upon creating a personal idea I’d choose sand painting (age’s 3 -11) and (age’s 12-up). The attraction promotes adult art as well as children art. 
Including many shades, eccentric colors, vibrant and settle colors of many. The sand includes black and white sand and course sand mixed with rocks. The lights projecting on the sand create a design and add a certain temperature coolness or warmth giving you a scientific climate change within earth’s  atmosphere (all tools included)On the foundation of the platform the sands laying on the lighting adds a vibrant as well as adventure within sight. 
•	For children (3-11) the sand box includes FEEL—TOUCH—HEAR sensory. Art for beginners and science for beginners.
•	For adults (12 and up) creates art of meditation — gardening strategies—poetic ideas—imagery—archeological studies—grasping scientific plant life. Architecture foundational creation.
I’m not sure sending a HTTP link for our group idea or a personal idea regarding campaigns gives the absolute correct assignment …just making sure… I’m sending you both.
